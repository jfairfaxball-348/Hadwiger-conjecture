# Session log

Notes made while working, newest session last. This is where failed attempts, surprises
and decisions go. It is a log, not authority: statuses live in the blueprint.

## 2026-10-07 — reorganisation session

Branch `lean-formalisation`, started from main `0d17783` (RL69 closeout).

### Step 0 (before any change)

- main was `0d17783`, equal to `origin/main`, as the instruction expected.
- `rl70-frontier-push` was local only, five commits ahead of main. Its one uncommitted
  change (three progress lines in `work/RL70/logs/census_B_n14_shard0of6.err`) was in
  `stash@{0}`, not in the working tree. The working tree, on main, held ten untracked
  `.exe`/`.pdb` build products under `work/RL70/scripts/census/`.
- Installed: git 2.54, elan 4.2.3, Lean and Lake 4.34.1 (also 4.32.0, 4.32.2), Python
  3.12, gh, curl, pdftotext. Nothing was installed.
- Paper, licence, and the search for an existing formalisation: `docs/PROVENANCE.md`.
- **Stop at Step 0.3.** A partial upstream formalisation exists. Reported to the user
  before any change. The user chose to proceed independently (`START_HERE.md`).

### Measuring what upstream had done

At the user's request the upstream Lean library was swept completely and its files for
this paper were compiled. Result: Proposition 3.5 and the conditional Corollary 1.2 chain
for `χ`, nothing else; about 1% of the total effort. Basis for that figure in
`blueprint/MILESTONES.md`.

**Mechanical failure met on the way, not a mathematical one.** The first compile attempt
ran in a deep temporary directory. Five Mathlib modules with long names could not be
written there (Windows long paths are disabled on this machine), so the three upstream
files that `import Mathlib` did not build, while the other seven did. Moving the scratch
project to a short path fixed it and all ten built. Lesson recorded in
`docs/LEAN_WORKFLOW.md`: keep the checkout at a short path.

### What was done

1. `rl70-frontier-push`: stash restored; log and `work/RL70/ABANDONED.md` committed
   (`7aec886`). Not pushed, not merged.
2. `lean-formalisation` created from main.
3. HC7 state frozen under `frozen-hc7-programme/` by `git mv`, unedited.
4. Lean project created; Mathlib checkout reused from the scratch build.
5. Statement layer written: definitions and target statements, 10 `sorry`.
6. Ledger, audit scripts, CI workflow.
7. `START_HERE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/`.
8. Blueprint, fidelity notes, paper issues, milestones.

### Lean notes

- At this Mathlib commit the `SimpleGraph` structure's fields are
  `symm : Std.Symm Adj` and `loopless : Std.Irrefl Adj`, so both need the anonymous
  constructor around the function (`⟨fun _ _ h => …⟩`). A bare function fails to elaborate.
- Mathlib's linter prefers `have` to `haveI` for a `Prop`-valued instance.
- `exact_mod_cast` carries `(h : ℝ) < (k : ℝ)` down to `ℕ` and up to `ℕ∞` in two steps
  without help.
- The Markdown table parser in `scripts/leanscan.py` splits cells on unescaped `|`. Write
  `\|` for a literal bar inside a table cell (for example `\|V\|`). An unescaped one
  shifted the columns and the audit reported an "unknown status"; the audit caught it.

### What was proved in this session

Only what is trivial, as instructed: `Hole.symm` (`DONE`); the final theorem and
`not_hadwigerConjecture` as glue from Corollary 1.2 (`PROVED_MODULO`, so still resting on
`sorry`).

### Not done, and why

- CI has not run: the branch is not pushed (the user is to be asked first).
- The fidelity notes are unreviewed; that is milestone M0.
- Lean Zulip was not searched directly for an existing formalisation (needs an account).
